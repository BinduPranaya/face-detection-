# face-detection-
This project implements a Face Recognition System using OpenCV and Python. The system can detect faces in real-time through a webcam and recognize individuals. It demonstrates how computer vision and machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world problems like attendance systems, security authentication, and visitor management.
